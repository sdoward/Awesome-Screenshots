## Usage

- Add the plugin
```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.sdoward.awesomescreenshots'
```

- Define colors in your gradle script

```groovy
screenShot {
    backgroundColor = "#4ab581"
    shadowColor = "#18824e"
    textColor = "#12613a"
}

```

- Create the directory for your screenshots

```
- [src]
  |
  + - [main]
      |
      + - [screenshots]
          |
          + - [en-US]
          |   |
          |   + - [original]
          |   |   |
          |   |   + - screenshot1.png
          |   |   |
          |   |   + - screenshot2.png
          |   |
          |   + - [awesome]
          |   |
          |   + - strings.xml
          |
          + - [de-DE]
          |   |
          |   + - [original]
          |   |   |
          |   |   + - screenshot1.png
          |   |   |
          |   |   + - screenshot2.png
          |   |
          |   + - strings.xml
          |   |
          |   + - [awesome]
```
- Add string resources - The strings should have the same name as the original screenshot appended with `-header1` and `-header2` 

 
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<resources>
    <screenshot1-header1>See Maps</screenshot1-header1>
    <screenshot1-header2>wherever you are</screenshot1-header2>
    <screenshot2-header1>Routes for...</screenshot2-header1>
    <screenshot2-header2>bikes, cars, and PT</screenshot2-header2>
</resources>
```

- Run `./gradlew createAwesomeScreenshots` and be happy :)
